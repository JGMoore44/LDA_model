# LDA_model
Linear Discriminant Analysis - model

This Repository contains an example r project I conducted to showcase classification techniques.

The Final Report (in pdf form) is found in the "Report" Folder.

Two Methods were used in this analysis

1) K-Nearest Neighbors was used and a plot is generated to show classification error as a function of number of neighbors used.

2) LDA was used and a grid showing the classification boundries is generated in the report.

Full scripts for both KNN and LDA models are found in the "knnScript.r" and "ldaScript.r" files
